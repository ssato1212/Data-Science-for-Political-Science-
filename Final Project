wdidata <- read.csv("wdidata20.csv")
##There are 8856 observations in this data. 

dataset <- subset(wdidata, select=c(country, region, year, NY.GDP.MKTP.CD, SE.PRM.CMPT.ZS, SL.UEM.TOTL.NE.ZS, SE.ADT.LITR.ZS))
##The data was subsetted to only include these five variables. I will be looking at the relationship 
##between these variables throughout my project. 

dataset1980 <- subset(dataset, (year <= 1999))
dataset2000 <- subset(dataset, (year >= 2000))
##I am subsetting the subsetted data into two groups; data from 1980-1999 and data from 2000 to 2020. 
##This is so that I can compare and see if the relationships between variables are consistent throughout these 40 years.

##Unemployment Rate over Time 

ggplot(dataset1980, aes(x=year, y=SL.UEM.TOTL.NE.ZS, color=region)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Unemployment Rate Over Time") +
  xlab("Year")+
  ylab("Unemployment Rate")
##The unemployment throughout the world has slightly increased over time from 1980. Consistently, the regions with the highest 
##unemployment rate are Europe & Central Asia, Latin America & Caribbean, and Sub-Saharan Africa. 

ggplot(dataset2000, aes(x=year, y=SL.UEM.TOTL.NE.ZS, color=region)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Unemployment Rate Over Time") +
  xlab("Year")+
  ylab("Unemployment Rate")
##The unemployment rate throughout the world has stayed relatively consistent since 2000. The maximum has been around 20% every year, with outliers 
##with high unemployment rates in Europe & Central Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. It seems that Latin America & Caribbean region's unemployment rates have decreased.

##Unemployment rate by region and GDP by region 

boxplot(SL.UEM.TOTL.NE.ZS ~ region, data=dataset,
        main="Unemployment Rate by Region",
        ylab="Unemployment Rate",
        xlab="Region",
        col = c("purple"))
##Unemployment rates are especially low in North America, and high in Sub-Saharan Africa 

boxplot(NY.GDP.MKTP.CD ~ region, data=dataset,
        main="GDP by Region",
        ylab="GDP Current US$",
        xlab="Region",
        col = c("blue"), 
        themes(axis.text.x=element_text(size=1)))
##North America is surpassing all other regions in GDP, with East Asia & Pacific as second.

##Does primary education completion rate affect a country's unemployment rate? 

plot(x=dataset1980$SE.PRM.CMPT.ZS,
     y=dataset1980$SL.UEM.TOTL.NE.ZS,
     main = "Relationship Between Primary Ed Completion Rate & Unemployment Rate",
     xlab = "Primary Ed Completion Rate", 
     ylab = "Unemployment Rate", 
     pch=16)
cor(dataset1980$SE.PRM.CMPT.ZS, dataset1980$SL.UEM.TOTL.NE.ZS, use = "pairwise")
##The correlation is 0.027. There is almost no correlation between the two variables from the years 1980 to 1999. 

plot(x=dataset2000$SE.PRM.CMPT.ZS,
     y=dataset2000$SL.UEM.TOTL.NE.ZS,
     main = "Relationship Between Primary Ed Completion Rate & Unemployment Rate",
     xlab = "Primary Ed Completion Rate", 
     ylab = "Unemployment Rate", 
     pch=16)
cor(dataset2000$SE.PRM.CMPT.ZS, dataset2000$SL.UEM.TOTL.NE.ZS, use = "pairwise")
##The correlation is 0.05. There is almost no correlation between the two variables from the years 2000 to 2020. 

##Overall, there is little to no correlation between primary education completion rate and unemployment rate.

##Does adult total literacy rate affect a country's unemployment rate? 

plot(x=dataset1980$SE.ADT.LITR.ZS,
     y=dataset1980$SL.UEM.TOTL.NE.ZS,
     main = "Relationship Between Literacy Rate & Unemployment Rate",
     xlab = "Literacy Rate", 
     ylab = "Unemployment Rate", 
     pch=16)
cor(dataset1980$SE.ADT.LITR.ZS, dataset1980$SL.UEM.TOTL.NE.ZS, use = "pairwise")
##The correlation is 0.31, higher than correlation with primary education completion rate. 
##There seems to be higher unemployment with higher the literacy, which is interesting and unexpected. 

plot(x=dataset2000$SE.ADT.LITR.ZS,
     y=dataset2000$SL.UEM.TOTL.NE.ZS,
     main = "Relationship Between Literacy Rate & Unemployment Rate",
     xlab = "Literacy Rate", 
     ylab = "Unemployment Rate", 
     pch=16)
cor(dataset2000$SE.ADT.LITR.ZS, dataset2000$SL.UEM.TOTL.NE.ZS, use = "pairwise")
##In later years between 2000 and 2020, there seems to be much less of a correlation between literacy and unemployment. 
##The correlation is 0.18. Again, the higher the literacy rate the higher the unemployment rate. 

##Overall, there is little correlation between literacy rate and unemployment rate, though they seem to be somewhat positively correlated. 
##As literacy rate increases, so does the unemployment rate.

##Does unemployment rate affect a country's GDP? Are there patterns with depending on regions? 

install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(dataset1980, aes(x=SL.UEM.TOTL.NE.ZS, y=NY.GDP.MKTP.CD, color=region)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Relationship between Unemployment Rate & GDP") +
  xlab("Unemployment Rate")+
  ylab("GDP Current US$")
cor(dataset1980$SL.UEM.TOTL.NE.ZS, dataset1980$NY.GDP.MKTP.CD, use = "pairwise")
##There is a -0.08 correlation between unemployment rate and GDP. As unemployment increases, GDP stays 
##very low. The highest GDP is clearly in North American region as well as the East Asia & Pacific regions, 
##both of which have under 10% unemployment rates. 

ggplot(dataset2000, aes(x=SL.UEM.TOTL.NE.ZS, y=NY.GDP.MKTP.CD, color=region)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Relationship between Unemployment Rate & GDP") +
  xlab("Unemployment Rate")+
  ylab("GDP Current US$")
cor(dataset2000$SL.UEM.TOTL.NE.ZS, dataset2000$NY.GDP.MKTP.CD, use = "pairwise")
##Recently, from the years 2000 to 2020, the relationship is even stronger than in the past. The correlation is -0.09. The unemployment is consistently low after around 20% 
##unemployment rate, and it is mostly the Sub-Saharan Africa region and Europe & Central Asia. 
##Again, North America and the East Asia & Pacific region have the highest GDPs, though they have exceeded the other regions even moreso in the recent years. 

##Overall, there is a clear correlation between unemployment rate and GDP. There is also a pattern with regions, and the pattern has only become 
##stronger since 2000. North America has the highest GDP, East Asia & Pacific has the second highest, with Europe & Central Asia the third highest. 
##The regions with the highest unemployment and lowest GDP are ironically also from the Europe & Central Asia region and also from Sub-Saharan Africa.

##Does primary education completion rate affect GDP? Are there patterns depending on region? 

ggplot(dataset1980, aes(x=SE.PRM.CMPT.ZS, y=NY.GDP.MKTP.CD, color=region)) +

  ylab("GDP Current US$")
cor(dataset1980$SE.PRM.CMPT.ZS, dataset1980$NY.GDP.MKTP.CD, use = "pairwise")
##There is a positive correlation of 0.26 between primary education completion rate and GDP. 
##Lowest primary education completion rates are in Sub-Saharan Africa, with the highest in East Asia & Pacific region. 
##There is a concentration of high primary education completion rate for Europe & Central Asia. 

ggplot(dataset2000, aes(x=SE.PRM.CMPT.ZS, y=NY.GDP.MKTP.CD, color=region)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Relationship between Primary Ed Completion Rate & GDP") +
  xlab("Primary Ed Completion Rate")+
  ylab("GDP Current US$")
cor(dataset2000$SE.PRM.CMPT.ZS, dataset2000$NY.GDP.MKTP.CD, use = "pairwise")
##The correlation is similar but less -- 0.12. The concentration of Europe & Central Asia is still there, but East Asia & Pacific region 
##seems to surpass in terms of GDP and primary education completion rate now. The lowest GDP/education rate stays the same 
##in Sub-Saharan Africa, and the highest GDP is North America.
